# Flask-program-for-Seed-dataset-in-ML

Here Flask program for Seed dataset is shown.

This Flask program is used to display the Prediction of Seed Target.

Seed dataset are taken into consider to form a wed-based Flask App.

Install Anaconda(Open Source Package)

Either use Spyder or Ipython .

I have used Spyder Notebook to run this Flask App.

Create a virtual environment before running Flask app.

Install Numpy, Flask, Pandas using Pip command.

First Run the model.py

Then app.py

Path for running the app User/ User_Name/ Anaconda3/ Folder name/ Paste Flask Seed from github

Unzip

Open Spyder console . Then flask-glass folder

After running app.py Copy the 127.0.0.1:5000/ using mouse button

Don't press ctrl+ C from keyboard else the console will exit the running part

Paste the url in browser and Enter the dataset value in order to predict Seed Class.
